Oxygen Optode 4330W/4330/4330F 
The Oxygen Optode 4330 is a compact fully integrated sensor 
for measuring the O2 concentration and temperature. 4330W 
is equipped with ultra-stable foil FDO701, while 4330F is 
equipped with fast response sensing foil Pst3 (See Sensing Foil 
Considerations overleaf). 

Advantages 

• Optical lifetime-based luminescence quenching 
measurement principle 
• Multipoint calibrated in 40 points 
• Long time stability with pre-burned foil and 
red reference LED 
• Low maintenance needs 
• Not stirring sensitive (it consumes no oxygen) 
• User friendly 
• Use with Aanderaa SeaGuard and SmartGuard Platform 
• Automatically detected and recognized 
• Use with other loggers, stand-alone sensor 
Since oxygen is involved in most of the biological and 
chemical processes in aquatic environments, it is a crucial parameter to 
measure. Oxygen can also be used as a tracer in oceanographic studies. 
Aanderaa revolutionized oceanographic oxygen monitoring/research 
with the introduction of oxygen optodes in 2002. Applications range 
from shallow creeks to the deepest trenches, from tropical to in-ice/insediment 
measurements. More than 200 scientific papers have so far been 
published using Aanderaa optodes.

Sensing Foil Considerations 

The Pst3 and FDO701 sensing foils are protected by an 
optical isolation layer which makes the foil extra rugged 
and insensitive to direct sunlight. The fast response sens-

Misleading specifications 

When Aanderaa states an absolute accuracy of e.g (±1.5% or ±2 μM) we mean the accuracy of 
the sensor in the field over the entire range of oxygen concentrations and temperatures, others 
might refer to accuracy in the laboratory just after the sensor was calibrated. When Aanderaa give 
response time in water others might refer to response time in air which is much faster. For more 
information read our Best Practice document on Oxygen Optodes.
