Goal: To test the degazing of water inside the tank by bubbling helium.
Methodology: Fill the tank with water, start bubbling helium at different flow rates, and monitor the oxygen decrease.
Then pump back the water to the pumping tank.
Redo by adding water to the tank? 
Ideas: Put the pumping tank to vertical to decrease volume and increase degazing efficiency..
Timeline (local time)

14:50:00 — Experiment launched and recording started. Water tank is full. O2 seems to be ~89.3% (check data).
14:55 — Started to put helium.
14:58 — Tried to move the helium inlet; broke the blue balloon gas diffuser; replaced it.
15:03 — Back to normal. Set helium to 1 L/min. ~89% oxygen. Manual mixing doesn’t seem to change anything.
15:09 — Set helium to 0.5 L/min (slower). TODO: calculate the change of slope with recording data.
15:11 — Set helium to 2 L/min. Doesn’t seem so much better than 2 L/min. TODO: calculate the slope of O2.
15:13 — Set helium back to 1 L/min.
15:17 — Closed the tank by putting the tap; this seems to increase the speed.
15:48 — Opened the tank (oxygen at ~6%).
15:49 — Sensors out of water.
15:53 — Pumped to the other tank and switched sensors (around 26%).

Water height: 290 mm
