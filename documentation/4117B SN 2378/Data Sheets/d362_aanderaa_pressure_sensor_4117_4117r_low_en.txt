In most measuring systems used in the sea, pressure is a vital parameter. For moored instruments the pressure can be used for determining the actual depth of the instrument. For instrumentation on the seabed the pressure can be used for deriving water level. The pressure is also vital when deriving other parameters as density and speed of sound. 
The Pressure Sensor is a compact yet intelligent sensor designed to be used on the Aanderaa SeaGuard as well as in other measuring systems. The sensor is based on a silicon piezo-resistive bridge sampled and temperature compensated by an advanced Digital Signal Processor. The sensor is housed in a rugged titanium cylinder. 
Since all calibration and temperature compensation data are stored inside the sensor, the pressure is by default presented directly in engineering units without any external calculation. Raw data can be selected as additional output. Two parameters are available; Pressure and Temperature. 
The The SeaGuard/SmartGuard and the Smart Sensors are interfaced by means of a reliable CANbus interface using an XML based protocol (AiCaP). 
Pressure Sensor 4117/4117R 
The Pressure Sensor 4117/4117R is a compact fully integrated sensor for measuring the pressure level and the water temperature. The 4117 sensor is designed to be mounted on the Aanderaa SeaGuard platform or connected to SmartGuard using AiCaP CANbus or as stand alone sensor using RS-232. The sensor is easily integrated in other measurement systems with dataloggers. The 4117R sensor is designed for use with long cables by means of RS-422 full duplex interface.

The Smart Sensors can be mounted directly on the top-end plate of the SeaGuard and are automatically detected and recognized. 
The output format of Pressure sensor 4117 are AiCaP and RS-232, while the output format of the 4117R is RS-422. The sersor version must be specified when ordered as the two versions are not interchangeable. The R-versiom cannot be used in SeaGuard applications. 
The 10-pin receptacle in the sensor foot mates with Aanderaa SP (Sealing plug), giving access to RS-232 output. For connection to a PC the Sensor Cable 4865 can be used. It is furnished with RS-232 plug and a watertight 10-pin plug. An additional USB plug is used for providing power. 
The pressure sensor can be used as stand-alone sensor with AADI Real-Time Collector for real-time data.
